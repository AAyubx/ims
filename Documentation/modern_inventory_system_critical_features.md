### Next Phase Priorities
1. Item & Catalog Management system
2. Stock Control & Movement tracking
3. Purchasing & Replenishment workflows

## 1) Architecture & Platform

- Service-oriented (modular monolith or microservices) with clear domain boundaries (Catalog, Stock, Orders, Suppliers).
- API-first: REST (OpenAPI) and/or GraphQL for all core domains; event streaming (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for async flows.
- Modern Java stack: Java 17+; Spring Boot/Spring Cloud or Quarkus/Micronaut; Maven/Gradle; JPA/Hibernate.
- 12‚Äëfactor app principles; externalized config; feature flags; blue/green or rolling deployments.
- Cloud-ready: containerized (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), auto-scaling, secrets via Vault/KMS.
- Edge/offline support for stores: local cache/queue; sync on reconnect; conflict resolution policies.

## 2) Multi‚ÄëStore, Multi‚ÄëChannel, Multi‚ÄëTenant (if applicable)

- Multi-store: locations, zones, bins; independent safety stock and lead times.
- Omnichannel: POS, e‚Äëcommerce, marketplace, and ERP integrations.
- Multi‚Äëcurrency, multi‚Äëlocale, tax/VAT rules per region; optional multi‚Äëtenant isolation.

## 3) Item & Catalog Management

- SKU, UPC/EAN/GTIN, variants (size/color), bundles/kits, BOM for packs.
- Rich attributes: brand, category, metadata, images, documents (MSDS).
- Lifecycle states: draft ‚Üí active ‚Üí discontinued; versioning & history.
- Category trees, search facets, tags; full‚Äëtext search (e.g., OpenSearch/Elastic).

## 4) Stock Control & Movements

- Real‚Äëtime on‚Äëhand, available‚Äëto‚Äëpromise (ATP), and reserved quantities.
- Inbound (ASN/receipts), outbound (shipments), transfers, cycle counts, adjustments.
- Serial/lot/batch tracking, expiry dates, FEFO/ FIFO strategies.
- Reason codes for adjustments; audit trails for all movements.

## 5) Purchasing & Replenishment

- Supplier master, terms, lead times, MOQ; purchase requests ‚Üí POs ‚Üí receipts.
- Demand forecasting and reorder policies (Min/Max, EOQ).
- Automated replenishment proposals with human approval workflow.
- Costing methods: standard/average/moving; landed cost allocations.

## 6) Pricing & Promotions

- Base price lists; zone‚Äëbased pricing; markdowns.
- Promotions/discount rules (BOGO, threshold, coupons), eligibility segments.
- Price simulation and effective‚Äëdate scheduling; price audit log.

## 7) Barcoding, Scanning & RFID

- Label templates (SKU/Location/Shipment), ZPL/PDF export.
- Mobile scanning (Android/iOS) for receiving, transfers, counts; camera or dedicated scanners.
- RFID (optional): read events ‚Üí inventory reconciliation rules.

## 8) Orders, Reservations & Fulfillment

- Omni order reservation (split shipments, partials), backorders.
- Pick/pack/ship workflows with wave/picklist optimization.
- Slotting/bin recommendations; packing validation; carrier integration.

## 9) Data Quality & Governance

- Validation rules, duplicate detection, required attribute policies.
- Reference data catalogs with stewardship.
- Audit & traceability: who/what/when; tamper‚Äëevident logs.

## 10) Security & Compliance

- RBAC with least privilege; SSO (OIDC/SAML) for backoffice.
- Field‚Äëlevel permissions (e.g., cost vs retail visibility).
- Data protection (PII for suppliers/customers): encryption in transit and at rest.
- Email service: Professional account creation notifications, password management emails.
- **Mandatory password change on first login**: Interactive modal with strength validation and policy enforcement.
- Compliance: VAT/GST recordkeeping, SOX‚Äëfriendly audit, GDPR/CCPA data subject tools.

## 11) Observability & Reliability

- Centralized logging (JSON), correlation IDs; metrics (Prometheus/Grafana).
- Tracing (OpenTelemetry); health/readiness probes.
- SLOs/SLIs for key APIs.
- Circuit breakers, retries with jitter; dead‚Äëletter queues; idempotency keys.

## 12) Reporting, Analytics & Insights

- Operational dashboards: stockouts, aging, turns, shrinkage, fill rate, OTIF.
- Near real‚Äëtime inventory ledger for reconciliation.
- Exports to BI tools (Parquet/Delta).
- Alerts & subscriptions (low stock, negative on‚Äëhand, expiring lots).

## 13) Extensibility & Integration

- Webhooks and event topics (StockAdjusted, PurchaseOrderReceived, TransferCreated).
- Connectors: POS, ERP (SAP, Oracle), e‚Äëcommerce (Shopify, Magento).
- Plugin/extension SDK with domain events and policy hooks.

- Inline validations; offline‚Äëcapable mobile apps.

## 15) Performance & Scalability Targets

- < 200ms p95 for read APIs; < 500ms p95 for write under nominal load.
- Horizontal scaling on reads/events.
- Eventual consistency windows: define SLAs for stock sync.

## 16) Testing & Quality

- Contract tests for APIs; consumer‚Äëdriven Pact tests.
- Test data factories; golden inventory scenarios.
- Automated E2E tests for core flows.

## 17) DevSecOps & Delivery
