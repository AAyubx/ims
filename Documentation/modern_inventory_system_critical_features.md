# Modern Store Inventory Management System — Critical Must‑Have Features (Java-based)

_Last updated: 2025-08-31 12:21 UTC_

## 1) Architecture & Platform
- Service-oriented (modular monolith or microservices) with clear domain boundaries (Catalog, Stock, Orders, Suppliers).
- API-first: REST (OpenAPI) and/or GraphQL for all core domains; event streaming (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for async flows.
- Modern Java stack: Java 17+; Spring Boot/Spring Cloud or Quarkus/Micronaut; Maven/Gradle; JPA/Hibernate.
- 12‑factor app principles; externalized config; feature flags; blue/green or rolling deployments.
- Cloud-ready: containerized (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), auto-scaling, secrets via Vault/KMS.
- Edge/offline support for stores: local cache/queue; sync on reconnect; conflict resolution policies.

## 2) Multi‑Store, Multi‑Channel, Multi‑Tenant (if applicable)
- Multi-store: locations, zones, bins; independent safety stock and lead times.
- Omnichannel: POS, e‑commerce, marketplace, and ERP integrations.
- Multi‑currency, multi‑locale, tax/VAT rules per region; optional multi‑tenant isolation.

## 3) Item & Catalog Management
- SKU, UPC/EAN/GTIN, variants (size/color), bundles/kits, BOM for packs.
- Rich attributes: brand, category, metadata, images, documents (MSDS).
- Lifecycle states: draft → active → discontinued; versioning & history.
- Category trees, search facets, tags; full‑text search (e.g., OpenSearch/Elastic).

## 4) Stock Control & Movements
- Real‑time on‑hand, available‑to‑promise (ATP), and reserved quantities.
- Inbound (ASN/receipts), outbound (shipments), transfers, cycle counts, adjustments.
- Serial/lot/batch tracking, expiry dates, FEFO/ FIFO strategies.
- Reason codes for adjustments; audit trails for all movements.

## 5) Purchasing & Replenishment
- Supplier master, terms, lead times, MOQ; purchase requests → POs → receipts.
- Demand forecasting and reorder policies (Min/Max, EOQ).
- Automated replenishment proposals with human approval workflow.
- Costing methods: standard/average/moving; landed cost allocations.

## 6) Pricing & Promotions
- Base price lists; zone‑based pricing; markdowns.
- Promotions/discount rules (BOGO, threshold, coupons), eligibility segments.
- Price simulation and effective‑date scheduling; price audit log.

## 7) Barcoding, Scanning & RFID
- Label templates (SKU/Location/Shipment), ZPL/PDF export.
- Mobile scanning (Android/iOS) for receiving, transfers, counts; camera or dedicated scanners.
- RFID (optional): read events → inventory reconciliation rules.

## 8) Orders, Reservations & Fulfillment
- Omni order reservation (split shipments, partials), backorders.
- Pick/pack/ship workflows with wave/picklist optimization.
- Slotting/bin recommendations; packing validation; carrier integration.

## 9) Data Quality & Governance
- Validation rules, duplicate detection, required attribute policies.
- Reference data catalogs with stewardship.
- Audit & traceability: who/what/when; tamper‑evident logs.

## 10) Security & Compliance
- RBAC with least privilege; SSO (OIDC/SAML) for backoffice.
- Field‑level permissions (e.g., cost vs retail visibility).
- Data protection (PII for suppliers/customers): encryption in transit and at rest.
- Email service: Professional account creation notifications, password management emails.
- **Mandatory password change on first login**: Interactive modal with strength validation and policy enforcement.
- Compliance: VAT/GST recordkeeping, SOX‑friendly audit, GDPR/CCPA data subject tools.

## 11) Observability & Reliability
- Centralized logging (JSON), correlation IDs; metrics (Prometheus/Grafana).
- Tracing (OpenTelemetry); health/readiness probes.
- SLOs/SLIs for key APIs.
- Circuit breakers, retries with jitter; dead‑letter queues; idempotency keys.

## 12) Reporting, Analytics & Insights
- Operational dashboards: stockouts, aging, turns, shrinkage, fill rate, OTIF.
- Near real‑time inventory ledger for reconciliation.
- Exports to BI tools (Parquet/Delta).
- Alerts & subscriptions (low stock, negative on‑hand, expiring lots).

## 13) Extensibility & Integration
- Webhooks and event topics (StockAdjusted, PurchaseOrderReceived, TransferCreated).
- Connectors: POS, ERP (SAP, Oracle), e‑commerce (Shopify, Magento).
- Plugin/extension SDK with domain events and policy hooks.

## 14) User Experience (Web & Mobile)
- Responsive admin UI (Next.js/React) with role‑based menus and real-time validation.
- Task-driven screens: receive, count, transfer, adjust, label print.
- Professional email templates: welcome emails, password notifications with company branding.
- **Interactive password change experience**: Modal with password strength indicator, clear requirements, and user-friendly validation.
- Inline validations; offline‑capable mobile apps.

## 15) Performance & Scalability Targets
- < 200ms p95 for read APIs; < 500ms p95 for write under nominal load.
- Horizontal scaling on reads/events.
- Eventual consistency windows: define SLAs for stock sync.

## 16) Testing & Quality
- Contract tests for APIs; consumer‑driven Pact tests.
- Test data factories; golden inventory scenarios.
- Automated E2E tests for core flows.

## 17) DevSecOps & Delivery
- CI/CD pipelines with quality gates.
- Infra as Code (Terraform/Helm); canary/blue‑green.
- Secrets management; dependency scans.
- Rollback playbooks; backup/restore drills.

## 18) Data Model (Minimum Entities)
- Item, Location, InventoryLedger, StockSummary, Supplier, PO, Receipt, Transfer, Adjustment.

## 19) Accessibility & Internationalization
- WCAG‑aware UI; keyboard shortcuts; color contrast.
- i18n/l10n for labels, date/number formats, currencies.

## 20) Governance Checklists (Go‑Live Readiness)
- API docs & versioning policy.
- RBAC matrices approved by operations & audit.
- Capacity plan & monitoring dashboards live.
- Data migration & reconciliation plan signed off.
- Runbooks for common incidents.
