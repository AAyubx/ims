# Cross‑Jurisdictions & Time Zones — Must‑Have Platform Features

Design for global operations: multiple legal regimes, currencies, locales, and clock rules. Each item lists **what**, **how**, and **why**.

---

## 1) Time Zone Correctness (Every Record, Every Event)
**What:** Store timestamps in **UTC**; display in user/site time zones with clear labels.  
**How:** Save `created_at/updated_at/effective_from/effective_to` as UTC; convert on render; include time zone in exports.  
**Why:** Prevents scheduling mistakes, audit confusion, and cross‑site misalignment.

---

## 2) Daylight Saving & Calendar Rules
**What:** Respect DST and regional calendar differences (Fri–Sat weekends, public holidays).  
**How:** Use IANA TZ database; central calendar service for holidays/blackout periods per country/site.  
**Why:** Accurate lead times, SLAs, cutoff times, and deployment windows.

---

## 3) Locale, Language, and Script
**What:** Full **i18n/L10n** for UI and data fields (names, descriptions).  
**How:** Locale packs for labels/messages; translatable fields on items (per language); **RTL** support for Arabic.  
**Why:** Usability and compliance in multilingual teams/markets.

---

## 4) Multi‑Currency & Rounding
**What:** Price lists and costs in multiple currencies with transparent FX handling.  
**How:** Store **base currency** + per‑currency overrides; record **FX rate source + timestamp**; configurable rounding and tax‑inclusive/exclusive display.  
**Why:** Accurate pricing & reporting across markets.

---

## 5) Tax Configuration by Jurisdiction
**What:** Tax classes/rules at country/state/city level; VAT/GST/sales tax support.  
**How:** Assign **tax class** to items; jurisdiction‑aware tax engines; exemptions and thresholds; digital services rules where applicable.  
**Why:** Legal compliance and correct totals in orders/invoices.

---

## 6) Import/Export Compliance
**What:** **HS Code**, **Country of Origin**, regulatory flags (hazmat, age restrictions).  
**How:** Maintain per‑jurisdiction compliance attributes; validation before publish/ship; documentation attachments (MSDS).  
**Why:** Smooth customs clearance and safety compliance.

---

## 7) Legal Entities, Sites, and Data Residency
**What:** Map items and transactions to **legal entity** and **site**; support data residency constraints.  
**How:** Entity/site metadata on records; region‑pinned storage (e.g., EU-only); access policies by entity.  
**Why:** Accounting integrity and privacy law adherence.

---

## 8) Access Control & Approvals by Region
**What:** Role‑ and region‑aware permissions and approval chains.  
**How:** RBAC with **scopes** (entity/site/region); dynamic approvers; segregation of duties (SoD) checks.  
**Why:** Governance without slowing local operations.

---

## 9) Numbering, Formatting & Local Conventions
**What:** Locale‑aware **dates, numbers, currency, units**, and address formats.  
**How:** ICU formatting; per‑user preference vs. per‑document locale; printable docs by region template.  
**Why:** Prevents misreads and reconciliation errors.

---

## 10) SLAs, Cutoffs, and Scheduled Jobs
**What:** Region‑specific SLAs, **order/transfer cutoffs**, and job schedules.  
**How:** Cron schedules per site TZ; calendars for holidays/DST; escalation chains per region.  
**Why:** Reliable operations and fair performance metrics.

---

## 11) Audit Trail with Context
**What:** Immutable logs including **who, what, when (UTC), where (entity/site/TZ)**.  
**How:** Append‑only audit store; correlation IDs across services; export with TZ context.  
**Why:** Investigations and compliance reporting.

---

## 12) Content & Policy Management per Region
**What:** Region‑specific labels, disclaimers, terms, and privacy notices.  
**How:** Feature flags by region; CMS slots for legal text; consent records with timestamp/TZ.  
**Why:** Legal clarity and customer trust.

---

## 13) Data Retention & Privacy
**What:** Retention schedules and anonymization rules by jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR).  
**How:** Policies at entity/site level; automatic purge/anonymize jobs; subject‑access export tooling.  
**Why:** Reduce legal risk; honour user rights.

---

## 14) Notifications & Reports in Local Time
**What:** Emails, alerts, and dashboards aligned to the recipient’s time zone and locale.  
**How:** Per‑user TZ setting; schedule conversions; include absolute UTC time in footers for reference.  
**Why:** Avoid missed windows and confusion across teams.

---

## 15) Disaster Recovery & Regional Resilience
**What:** Region‑aware backup/restore and failover.  
**How:** Cross‑region replication respecting residency; runbooks with local contact trees; TZ‑aware RPO/RTO targets.  
**Why:** Ensure continuity despite regional outages.

---

## 16) Testing & Sandbox Parity
**What:** Multi‑region QA data and clock skew tests.  
**How:** Seed sandboxes with region‑specific calendars, taxes, currencies; simulate DST changes.  
**Why:** Catch bugs before they hit production in another region.

---

## 17) API Contracts with TZ & Locale Semantics
**What:** Explicit fields for `timezone`, `locale`, `currency`, and `effective_*` in APIs.  
**How:** OpenAPI examples showing UTC storage and localized display rules; contract tests for DST boundaries.  
**Why:** Eliminate ambiguity for integrators.

---

## 18) Governance Dashboards
**What:** Views for **config drift**, tax coverage, translation completeness, and SLA adherence by region.  
**How:** Aggregated metrics with drill‑downs per entity/site; exception alerts.  
**Why:** Proactive control over global complexity.
